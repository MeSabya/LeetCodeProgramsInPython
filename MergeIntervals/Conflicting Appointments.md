### Given an array of intervals representing ‘N’ appointments, find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

#### Example 1:

Appointments: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

#### Example 2:

Appointments: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: true
Explanation: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.

#### Example 3:

Appointments: [[4,5], [2,3], [3,6]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [4,5] and [3,6] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

```cpp
using namespace std;

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Interval {
 public:
  int start;
  int end;

  Interval(int start, int end) {
    this->start = start;
    this->end = end;
  }
};

class ConflictingAppointments {
 public:
  static bool canAttendAllAppointments(vector<Interval>& intervals) {
    // sort the intervals by start time
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(),
         [](const Interval& x, const Interval& y) { return x.start < y.start; });

    // find any overlapping appointment
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
      if (intervals[i].start < intervals[i - 1].end) {
        // please note the comparison above, it is "<" and not "<="
        // while merging we needed "<=" comparison, as we will be merging the two
        // intervals having condition "intervals[i].start == intervals[i - 1].end" but
        // such intervals don't represent conflicting appointments as one starts right
        // after the other
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
