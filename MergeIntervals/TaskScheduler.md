***Given a character array tasks, where each character represents a unique task, and a positive integer n that 
represents the cooling period between any two identical tasks, find the minimum number of time units the CPU will need 
to complete all the given tasks. Each task requires one unit to perform, and the CPU must wait for at least n units of time before it can repeat the same task. 
During the cooling period, the CPU may perform other tasks or remain idle.***

```shell
tasks = ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B']
n = 2
One way to arrange the tasks is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B. This takes 8 time units in total.
```

k is initialized as n+1 because you are allowed to schedule up to n+1 tasks before the next cooldown.
You pop a task from the heap, decrement its frequency (since itâ€™s been used), and push it into idle_que if it still has remaining executions (i.e., if its frequency is greater than 1).
k is decremented to track how many more tasks or idle slots can be processed in this cycle.
