ðŸ‘‰ Approach1: In case of merged interval problem always check if the input is sorted or not. 

ðŸ‘‰ Step1: Sort the input intervals based on start time.

ðŸ‘‰ Step2: Check for all interval overlap options , 
   for example : in between interval1 and interval2 , check interval1 overlaps with interval2 or interval2 overlaps with interval1.
   Both can be possible.
