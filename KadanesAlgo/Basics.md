# Maximum Subarray 

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

7 has boarded a new train because sum of [4, 3, -2, 6, -14] = -3. So if it boards the running train the result would be -3+7 = 4 and if it boards new train it will be 7. 

So start a new train with 7.
