## Insert new item and shift Up
Assume we have a max-heap, and we need to add a new item. If the heap is an array, we append it to the end. After that, we have to execute the shift up function.

Form the images below, the main step is

***comparing the child item to its parent item, if the child item is larger than parent item, we exchange them.***

As the heap is a tree-like structure, we can easily locate the parent item which is int(k/2) where k is the current child item. The rest can be done in the same manner.

**Time complicity: O (logn)**

#### This is a Max heap:

## Delete item and shift down
When it comes to shift down, heap has its special way to delete the item. We canâ€™t delete any item we want. As the images mentioned,

we replace the first item with the bottom one and shift down

When we do shifting down, we can locate its children node which are 2k (left) and 2k + 1 (right). Then we compare the parent item to left and right item to find the largest one to exchange. If the parent item is the largest value, we stay still.

**Time complicity: O (logn)**

#### This is a Max heap:
