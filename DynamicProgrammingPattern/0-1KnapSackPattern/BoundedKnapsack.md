#### SubSetSum Problem 
1. [Sub set sum](https://github.com/MeSabya/LeetCodeProgramsInPython/blob/master/DynamicProgrammingPattern/0-1KnapSackPattern/SubSetSum.py)
2. [Equal Subset Sum Partition (medium)](https://github.com/MeSabya/LeetCodeProgramsInPython/blob/master/DynamicProgrammingPattern/0-1KnapSackPattern/EqualSubsetSumPartition.py)
3. :atom: [Minimum Subset Sum Difference (hard)]()
4. [Count of Subset Sum (hard)]()
5. :atom: [Target Sum (hard)]()

#### All the above problems are same in nature and also in computation:
1. Time and Space Complexity of all the problem is O(N * S). Where N is number of items and S is the Sum.
2. Only the two from the above prefixed with :atom: are bit different from the traditional subset sum approach, otherwise all are same.
3. In all subset problems : condtion to exclude the item comes before include item condition.
4. In all subset related problem the problem starts with identifying the SUM ,then identifying subproblems to achieve the target sum.
