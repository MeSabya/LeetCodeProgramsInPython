# Difference between 0/1 KS and SubsetSum problem, 
**In KS we have considered both included and excluded condition. Where as included and excluded condition is mutually exclusive in SubsetSum Problem.**
Reason is : In KS we need to find the maximum profit after including and excluding the item , where as in subset sum we need to find the sum and we can only inlcude or exclude 
once.
