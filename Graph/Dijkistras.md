# Finding The Shortest Path, With A Little Help From Dijkstra

- finding the shortest path between two nodes becomes much trickier when we have to take into account the weights of the edges that weâ€™re traversing through.

ğŸ‘‰ *Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be used to determine the shortest path from one node in a graph to every other node within the same graph data structure, provided that the nodes are reachable from the starting node.*

***The algorithm below works for both directed or undirected graph as long as it does not have negative weight on an edge.***

```python

import heapq
# graph is represented by adjacency list: List[List[pair]]
# s is the source vertex
def dijkstra(graph, s):
    # set is used to mark finalized vertices
    visited = set()
    # an array to keep the distance from s to this vertex.
    # initialize all distances as infinite, except s
    dist = [float('inf')] * len(graph)
    dist[s] = 0
    # priority queue containing (distance, vertex)
    min_heap = [(0, s)]

    while min_heap:
        # pop the vertex with the minimum distance
        _, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)       

        for v, weight in graph[u]:          
            # If there is shorted path from s to v through u.
            # s -> u -> v
            if dist[v] > (dist[u] + weight):
                # Updating distance of v
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                # insert to the queue
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (dist[v], v))

    return dist
```

ğŸ‘‰ *Time complexity is O(V + VlogE), where V is number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph.*
