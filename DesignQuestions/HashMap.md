# Design a Hashmap 

```Lua
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the MyHashMap class:

MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. 
If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.
``` 
 
 ```python
 # Capacity for internal array
INITIAL_CAPACITY = 50

# Node data structure - essentially a LinkedList node
class Node:
	def __init__(self, key, value):
		self.key = key
		self.value = value
		self.next = None
	def __str__(self):
		return "<Node: (%s, %s), next: %s>" % (self.key, self.value, self.next != None)
	def __repr__(self):
		return str(self)
# Hash table with separate chaining
class HashTable:
	# Initialize hash table
	def __init__(self):
		self.capacity = INITIAL_CAPACITY
		self.size = 0
		self.buckets = [None]*self.capacity
	# Generate a hash for a given key
	# Input:  key - string
	# Output: Index from 0 to self.capacity
	def hash(self, key):
		hashsum = 0
		# For each character in the key
		for idx, c in enumerate(key):
			# Add (index + length of key) ^ (current char code)
			hashsum += (idx + len(key)) ** ord(c)
			# Perform modulus to keep hashsum in range [0, self.capacity - 1]
			hashsum = hashsum % self.capacity
		return hashsum

	# Insert a key,value pair to the hashtable
	# Input:  key - string
	# 		  value - anything
	# Output: void
	def insert(self, key, value):
		# 1. Increment size
		self.size += 1
		# 2. Compute index of key
		index = self.hash(key)
		# Go to the node corresponding to the hash
		node = self.buckets[index]
		# 3. If bucket is empty:
		if node is None:
			# Create node, add it, return
			self.buckets[index] = Node(key, value)
			return
		# 4. Iterate to the end of the linked list at provided index
		prev = node
		while node is not None:
			prev = node
			node = node.next
		# Add a new node at the end of the list with provided key/value
		prev.next = Node(key, value)

	# Find a data value based on key
	# Input:  key - string
	# Output: value stored under "key" or None if not found
	def find(self, key):
		# 1. Compute hash
		index = self.hash(key)
		# 2. Go to first node in list at bucket
		node = self.buckets[index]
		# 3. Traverse the linked list at this node
		while node is not None and node.key != key:
			node = node.next
		# 4. Now, node is the requested key/value pair or None
		if node is None:
			# Not found
			return None
		else:
			# Found - return the data value
			return node.value

	# Remove node stored at key
	# Input:  key - string
	# Output: removed data value or None if not found
	def remove(self, key):
		# 1. Compute hash
		index = self.hash(key)
		node = self.buckets[index]
		prev = None
		# 2. Iterate to the requested node
		while node is not None and node.key != key:
			prev = node
			node = node.next
		# Now, node is either the requested node or none
		if node is None:
			# 3. Key not found
			return None
		else:
			# 4. The key was found.
			self.size -= 1
			result = node.value
			# Delete this element in linked list
			if prev is None:
				self.buckets[index] = node.next # May be None, or the next match
			else:
				prev.next = prev.next.next # LinkedList delete by skipping over
			# Return the deleted result 
			return result
```

## Solution Explanation

***Question1: How the above solves the collisons?***

*Whenever two keys have the same hash value, it is considered a collision. What should our hash table do? If it just wrote the data into the location anyway, we would be losing the object that is already stored under a different key.
With separate chaining, we create a Linked List at each index of our buckets array, containing all keys for a given index. When we need to look up one of those items, we iterate the list until we find the Node matching the requested key.*


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
```
Each bucket will actually contain a LinkedList of nodes containing the objects stored at that index. This is one method of **collision resolution.**

***Question2: How to handle uneven distribution of keys ?***

The above is called as uneven distribution , as most of the keys are mapped to bucket 1. Because our hash function must be h(x) = 1. 
In order to maintain a proper distribution across the buckets , our hash function is like below:

```python
def hash(self, key):
	hashsum = 0
	# For each character in the key

	for idx, c in enumerate(key):
		# Add (index + length of key) ^ (current char code)

		hashsum += (idx + len(key)) ** ord(c)
		# Perform modulus to keep hashsum in range [0, self.capacity - 1]

		hashsum = hashsum % self.capacity
	return hashsum
```
