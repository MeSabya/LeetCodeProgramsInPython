# You are given an array of N integers. You have to determine the maximum difference between two indices i and j, such that i < j and Array[i] < Array[j].

>Letâ€™s understand it using an example.
>Example 1:
>Input: [4, 2, 8, 9, 11, 4, 3, 1]
>Output: 5
>Explanation: Indices 1 and 6 satisfy the constraints as 1 < 6 and Array[1] < Array[6], (2 < 3).

>Example 2:
>Input: [4, 3, 2, 1]
>Output: -1
>Explanation: There are no pair of indices that fullfill the given constraints.
