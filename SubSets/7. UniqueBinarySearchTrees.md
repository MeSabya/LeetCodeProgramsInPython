## Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard)
Given a number â€˜nâ€™, write a function to return all structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that can store values 1 to â€˜nâ€™?

### Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
Explanation: Here are the 2 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 2:

### Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
Explanation: Here are the 5 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 3:

## Explanation
We will use a recursive helper function bst(start, end) that receives a range (start to end, within n) and returns all BST's rooted in that range.

Now let's look how our helper function will work!

As there will be trees with root as 1, 2, 3...n. Iterate through all values from start to end to construct tree rooted at i and construct its left and right subtree recursively.

We know that in Binary Search Tree all nodes in left subtree are smaller than root and in right subtree are larger than root. So for start = 1 and end = n, if we have ith number as root, all numbers from 1 to i-1 will be in left subtree and i+1 to n will be in right subtree.
Therefore, we will build the tree recursively for left and right subtrees rooted at i as leftSubTree = bst(start, i-1) and rightSubtree = bst(i + 1, end)
So, till what moment we will recursively find the left and right subtrees?? Answer is until start < end!!
So when start > end, add NULL to the list and return
This will be our base case!
Now, we have leftSubtree and rightSubtree for node with root i. The last thing we need to do is connect leftSubTree and rightSubTree with root and add this tree(rooted at i) to the ans list!

ðŸ“Œ Here, we can have multiple left and right subtrees. So we need to loop through all left and right subtrees and connect every left subTree to right subTree and to current root(i) one by one.

```python

class TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, val):
    self.val = val
    self.left = None
    self.right = None


def find_unique_trees(n):
  if n <= 0:
    return []
  return findUnique_trees_recursive(1, n)


def findUnique_trees_recursive(start, end):
  result = []
  # base condition, return 'None' for an empty sub-tree
  # consider n = 1, in this case we will have start = end = 1, this means we should have only one tree
  # we will have two recursive calls, findUniqueTreesRecursive(1, 0) & (2, 1)
  # both of these should return 'None' for the left and the right child
  if start > end:
    result.append(None)
    return result

  for i in range(start, end+1):
    # making 'i' the root of the tree
    leftSubtrees = findUnique_trees_recursive(start, i - 1)
    rightSubtrees = findUnique_trees_recursive(i + 1, end)
    for leftTree in leftSubtrees:
      for rightTree in rightSubtrees:
        root = TreeNode(i)
        root.left = leftTree
        root.right = rightTree
        result.append(root)

  return result


def main():
  print("Total trees: " + str(len(find_unique_trees(2))))
  print("Total trees: " + str(len(find_unique_trees(3))))


main()
```
